		<p>
			You're the person who gets to tell what's the clash between Rohindar and Malmedock. What's the
			conflict? The rivalry, the battle, the face-off, the challenge, the match... Write a scene in
			your mind that describes the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The contest: a situation where one can win and the other lose</li>
			<li>The win condition (optional. if it's not already clear)</li>
			<li>The place (optional. if it helps to enrich the scene.)</li>
			<li>The time (optional. if it helps to enrich the scene.)</li>
		</ul>

		<em>
			* Try to assume, however, as little as possible about Rohindar and Malmedock. They can be
			anyone... or anything.
